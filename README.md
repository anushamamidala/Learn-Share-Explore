## JS Description

### **Amrinder Kaur** - *Quiz and interaction Module*

#### FAQ Page

I have used json and jquery to this page to make it more interactive and colorful for the user.

#### QUIZ Pages

JavaScript in quiz is added to make it more interactive to the users, questions are displayed on the page with the submit button on the top.
Submit button receives the response of the students and calculates the total number of correct questions attempted and displays the results onscreen.




#### Interaction Page

JavaScript in interaction pages would help users to easily interact among themselves without any
external help.
Questions and answers would be displayed on the page on click.Concept of local storage is used here.
Also, I have added form validation.

### **Anusha Mamidala** - *Home Module* 

#### Home Page

Home page has some buttons which should do something on the click which I want to add using JS. And remove some repetative html code.

#### Course Page

In the course Page I have multiple course blocks in which the code is repetative so by using the JS I wanted to pass
the values through an array and remove the repetative blocks of JS. And I even have a dropdown and search and filter so I want to make sure they work.

#### Course Video Page

In the course video Page is opened when we click on a particular page in the courses

### **Navdeeep** - *Profile Module*

#### Student/Teachern Profile Page

In the Student profile page, the Data regarding the student is displayed from the local storage and the image on the profile changes when mouse hovers over it.

#### QnA Page

In QnA page, all the question except the first one are fetched from a Json file maintained by us.
On top the image for QnA changes as we hover the mouse over it
in the form below we validate the data that is being entered with a wrong input being reported immediately.
once all the inputs are correct, they are uploaded onto the local storage for maintainance.

#### About Us Page

In the About Us page, we display all the terms of use from an array stored in JavaScript.


### **Inderjit Singh** - *Login Module*

#### Login Page

In login page , I have used javascript in order to get data from the local storage. Usernames and passwords are fetched from the local storage which are stored in the form of an array. The data entered by the user is then compared with the data stored in the local storage using functions.So, if the user is authorized ,only then he/she is allowed to login the site. Otherwise, the access is denied using proper validations

#### Register Page

In registration page , I have used javascript in order to provide proper validations in the registration form. I have used patter for email , password.There are specific checks on the data entered by the user. Apart from this , I have used local storage in order to store the data entered by the user ,which is accessed when the user logs in the site.

#### Blog page

In blog page, I have used javascript to give dynamically access some data from array which contains content in JS file.

#### Course overview page

In this page, my code is dynamic. I have used various types of functionalities like search option , providing rating system , getting the overview of various topics on courses. I have used javascript,jquery,JSON, Awesome fonts,bootstrap cdn to accomplish this task.The JSON data is loaded automatically using jQuery.
