## JS Description

### **Amrinder Kaur** - *Quiz and interaction Module*

#### FAQ Page

I have used json and jquery to this page to make it more interactive to the user.

#### QUIZ Pages

JavaScript in quiz would be added to make it more interactive to the users, only one question would be
displayed on the page but as the user is well off to go to the next question, they can click the next
button to do so.

Next button will check if the current question is been answered, adds total number of questions
attempted out of total questions and checks if the answer is correct before moving on to the next
question.



Link of jquery page to be tested is  127.0.0.1:5501/jQuery.html


#### Interaction Page

JavaScript in interaction pages would help users to easily interact among themselves without any
external help.
Questions and answers would be displayed on the page on click.
Also, I need to add form validation.

### **Anusha Mamidala** - *Home Module* 

#### Course Page

In the course Page I have multiple course blocks in which the code is repetative so by using the JS I wanted to pass
the values through an array and remove the repetative blocks of JS. And I even have a dropdown and search and filter so I want to make sure they work.

#### Home Page

Home page has some buttons which should do something on the click which I want to add using JS. And remove some repetative html code.

### **Navdeeep** - *Profile Module*

#### Student/Teachern Profile Page

In the teacher and student profile page, will validate data of the user and display them

#### QnA Page

In QnA will display the question and answer based on different user entering them.

#### About Us Page

In the About Us page will shift points from HTML to JS where lists are used.


### **Inderjit Singh** - *Login Module*

#### Login Page

I will validate the login form using javascript so that before redirecting to the next page, there are some checks on the data entered by the user for authorization purpose and based upon the data user have entered,there would be some alert messages in order to notify the user about it.

#### Register Page

javascript will be used in this page to validate the field data entered by the user.There would be some patter matching concepts which i will try to implement so that proper checks can be made in order to validate the registration.Apart from this,there would be some alerts based on the success status of registraion.

#### Blog page

In this page, my code is repetative . So, i will try to code the page using an array or list in order to make my page dynamic to some extent.

#### Course overview page

In this page, my code is dynamic. I have various types of functionalities like search option , providing rating system , getting the overview of various topics on courses. I have used javascript,jquery, bootstrap cdn to accomplish this task.
